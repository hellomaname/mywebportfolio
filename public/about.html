<h1>About Me</h1>
<p> Hello there my name is Jack and I am currently 19 years old. Since I can remember my favorite passion has always been technology
  whether that be building computers or selling them, I have always known that I have wanted to persue a career in the tech industry
  which is what lead me to web development.</p>
  
<p>I first discovered web development, and the potential which it brings, earlier this year and I instantly fell in love. The ability 
  to create something so advanced that it can take days to code just one page fascinated me and I wanted to know more, which is where I found 
  Dr. Angela Yu's course. This bootcamp has only made my interest grow and I now know that this is what I want to do in my life, in particular 
  freelance web development.
</p>

<p>I can't gurantee much in this life, but what I can gurantee is that I will put everything I have into every line of code I type and into every 
  website I create. What's the good of working if you can't take pride in it?
